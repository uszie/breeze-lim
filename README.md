### Locally Integrated Menus

This hides the AppMenu icon button and draws the menu in the titlebar.

Make sure you add the AppMenu button in System Settings > Application Style > Window Decorations > Buttons Tab.

TODO/Bugs ([Issue #1](https://github.com/Zren/material-decoration/issues/1)):

* Open Submenu on Shortcut (eg: `Alt+F`)
* Display mnemonics when holding `Alt`

### Installation

#### Binary package

- Arch/Manjaro (AUR):  
  Install the `material-kwin-decoration-git` AUR package.  
  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/material-kwin-decoration-git/

- openSUSE:  
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:trmdi/material-decoration
```
sudo zypper ar obs://home:trmdi trmdi
sudo zypper in -r trmdi material-decoration
```

#### Building from source
Build dependencies:

- Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt build-dep breeze
sudo apt build-dep kwin
```


Download the source:

```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/Zren/material-decoration.git
cd material-decoration
```

Then compile the decoration, and install it:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
sudo make install
```

Select Material in System Settings > Application Style > Window Decorations.

To test changes, restart `kwin_x11` with:

```
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*=false;kdecoration.material=true" kstart5 -- kwin_x11 --replace
```

### Update

On 2020 June 18, the kdecoration id was changed from `zzag` to `zren`. You will need to re-select `Material` in System Settings > Application Style > Window Decoration. KWin will fallback to `Breeze` if you forget to do this.

#### Building from source

First navigate to the source directory, and `git pull` recent changes.

```
cd ~/Downloads/material-decoration
git pull origin master --ff-only
```

Then re-run the install instructions.
